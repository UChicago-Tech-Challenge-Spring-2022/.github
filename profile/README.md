## Description
UChicago CS Course Advising website is a prototype developed by Todd Tan, Yilan Liu, Patricia Zhou, Mike Wu, and Yuanyi Zhang for the 2022 UChicago Tech Community Challenge.

It's purpose is threefold: 1) to offer a guidance to UChicago undergraduates about their course selections; 2) to establish a platform where students could plan their courses with a balanced schedule; and 3) to provide a service that could help students get into full classes.

## Status
The challenge has ended! We won the title "Best Use of Technology" and $3000 cash!
Some progress will continue to be made if members are interested. Stay-tuned!
